# TODO for Prim's Algorithm Implementation

- [x] Create sample input file `Inputs/input_Prims.txt` with V=4 and a sample adjacency matrix for testing.
- [x] Update `prims.c` to read V, allocate adjacency matrix, implement Prim's algorithm using arrays (key, parent, mstSet), compute MST, and output edges and total weight to `Outputs/Prims.txt`.
- [x] Compile `prims.c` using gcc.
- [x] Run the compiled program and verify the output in `Outputs/Prims.txt`.
